KNIME, the Konstanz Information Miner, is an open source data analytics, reporting and integration platform. KNIME integrates various components for machine learning and data mining through its modular data pipelining concept. A graphical user interface allows assembly of nodes for data preprocessing (ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading), for modeling and data analysis and visualization.

Since 2006, KNIME has been used in pharmaceutical research,[1] but is also used in other areas like CRM customer data analysis, business intelligence and financial data analysis.
